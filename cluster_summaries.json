      "Pretty good Primer. It does a good job at smoothing and mattifying the skin. I do feel like there are other primers out there that have this same effect, i.e Wet n wild matte, but its a good option if you want the luxury of the glass packaging. My oilslick of a face ate right through it all within an hour but if youre looking for a smoothing and soft effect, this is the one. Personally prefer the Original Instant Retouch primer"

      "I have oily skin and can normally go about 2 hours without getting oily. I bought the original fenty primer and can wear that about 4 hours without getting oily so I thought this would extend that to around 6 hours. NOPE. It makes me super greasy and is actually worse than if I didn't use primer. My face is good for about 30 minutes and then it looks gross.",
      "I had a bad reaction to this product not sure if it was the combination of products but I would try it again.",
      "This product is amazing when it comes to the design, fragrance, texture, etc... but Iâ€™m so sad to say this primer do not work at all to keep my face from getting oily.  So bad that my face started getting shiny just in 20min time while I was still working on my eye makeup..... I love Fenty beauty and was so excited when this primer came out but this product donâ€™t do its job for me.  Otherwise it smells great and I really love the silky texture."
